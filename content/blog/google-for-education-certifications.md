So after spending the week filming my edTPA lessons, I decided to reward myself
in a way that any educator might find relaxing; I took a test. I had been looking
at the [Google for Education Certifications](https://edutrainingcenter.withgoogle.com/certification)
for a while, but I just hadn't taken the time to sit down and do it. I have quite
a few applications that are built with G Suite Apps, with many of them Education
based, so I thought it would only be appropriate to get the official nod from
Google that I was proficent with their systems.

## Google Certifed Educator Certifications

These certifications are given by Google to assess teachers' understanding of
G Suite for Education, and assess their ability to deeply integrate them into
their traditional classroom. There are four levels of certification. The first
two are the most common and aptly named "Google Certified Educator: Level 1" and
"Google Certified Educator: Level 2." These are the meat and potates of the
certification that truely assess your ability to use the applications with your class.

The [Level 1 Certification](https://edutrainingcenter.withgoogle.com/certification_level1)
focuses on the fundamentals of using the applications and assess the majority of
the basic features in each (for example, using Labels in Gmail). The [Level 2 Certification](https://edutrainingcenter.withgoogle.com/certification_level2)
expands on the fundamentals from the first assessment to address some of the more
advanced features of using the applications (for example, using Canned Responses
in Gmail). If you are an educator that would like to learn more about how to use
Google for Education to enhance student learning, save time in and out of the
classroom, and encourage professional growth within yourself and your colleagues,
these first two certifications are you.

Both [Level 1](https://edutrainingcenter.withgoogle.com/fundamentals/course) (also
called Fundamentals) and [Level 2](https://edutrainingcenter.withgoogle.com/advanced_training/course)
(also called Advanced) provide extensive training for *free*. These training
programs are excellently designed and interactive to help you understand the
content. Each unit also has a quiz at the end so you can test your knowledge and
see how the questions are asked. The Level 1 Exam costs $10 and the Level 2 Exam
costs $25. You have 180 minutes on each exam to answer 40 traditional questions
and 20 task-based questions.

## Google Certified Trainer

If you are an Instructional Technology Specialist, or just interested in teaching
others how to use G Suite for Education, you might consider applying to their
[Certified Trainer Program](https://edutrainingcenter.withgoogle.com/certification_trainer).
Google Certifed Trainers gain access to numerous resources, but a couple important
ones to take note of are each trainer recieves a **G Suite for Education demo
domain** and **exclusive looks at new Google product launches**. As a trainer, it
is important that you be able to teach and experiment with all the features of G
Suite. Having your own demo domain allows you to do this whenever and wherever at
no cost. As a trainer, you also need to be ready to teach others about the new
products when they are released. Early access to new products allows you to do this.

There are a few parts to the application. First you must complete the [Trainer Course](https://edutrainingcenter.withgoogle.com/trainer_course/course),
Trainer Skills Assessment ($20), Google Certified Educator: Level 1, and Google
Certified Educator: Level 2. The major part of applying to be a trainer is that
you must submit a 3-minute video as a job interview and to prove your ability to
teach a concept.

Google Certified Trainers are required and report at least 12 different training
sessions per year, be an active member of the trainer community, and resubmit a
declaration of interest each year.
